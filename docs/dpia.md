4. **Transfer Impact Assessments**: Regular assessment of transfer risks

## Conclusion and Recommendations

### Overall Risk Assessment

The overall risk to data subjects from the processing activities is considered **MEDIUM** with the implementation of all identified controls. The API implements a comprehensive set of security measures and data protection controls that significantly reduce the inherent risks of processing personal data.

### Recommendations

1. **Encryption Enhancement**: Implement the KMS integration for all sensitive data fields
2. **Regular Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing and security assessments
3. **Consent Management**: Enhance the consent management system with clearer purpose definitions
4. **Data Minimization**: Review data collection to ensure only necessary data is processed
5. **Monitoring**: Implement advanced security monitoring and alerting
6. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date processing records and data flow diagrams
7. **Training**: Provide regular security and data protection training to all staff
