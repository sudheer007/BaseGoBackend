# Vendor Security Management

## Overview

This document outlines the vendor security management program for the GoBackend Secure API. It defines the processes, requirements, and monitoring activities to ensure that third-party vendors and dependencies meet our security standards.

## Vendor Security Risk Assessment

### Risk Assessment Process

1. **Initial Vendor Categorization**
   - Critical: Direct access to production systems or sensitive data
   - High: Access to non-production systems or limited sensitive data
   - Moderate: No direct access to systems or sensitive data
   - Low: Minimal security impact

2. **Assessment Depth Based on Category**
   - Critical/High: Comprehensive assessment required
   - Moderate: Standard assessment required
   - Low: Basic assessment required

3. **Assessment Frequency**
   - Critical: Annually
   - High: Annually
   - Moderate: Every 2 years
   - Low: Every 3 years

### Assessment Criteria

#### Security Controls Assessment

| Category | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| Access Management | Authentication mechanisms, access review process, privilege management |
| Network Security | Network segmentation, firewalls, intrusion detection |
| Application Security | SDLC practices, vulnerability management, code security |
| Data Protection | Encryption, data classification, privacy controls |
| Incident Response | IR capabilities, breach notification, recovery processes |

   - Consider semantic versioning practices
   - Document version pinning decisions

3. **Dependency Updates**
   - Regular update schedule for non-critical updates
   - Immediate updates for security patches
   - Proper testing before updating in production

4. **Dependency Documentation**
   - Maintain a software bill of materials (SBOM)
   - Document dependency purpose and usage
   - Track dependency ownership internally

### Tooling and Automation
