- Implement proper session management

**Data Protection**:
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Implement proper key management
- Apply data classification and handling procedures
- Implement secure data deletion

**Error Handling & Logging**:
- Implement structured error handling
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
- Create security-relevant logs
- Protect log integrity

**API Security**:
- Implement rate limiting
- Use proper API authentication
- Validate all API inputs
- Apply principle of least privilege to API endpoints

**Dependency Management**:
- Use only approved dependencies
- Maintain an inventory of dependencies
- Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Follow a process for updating dependencies

### Security Testing Approaches

**Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**:
- Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline
- Establish security gates based on SAST results
- Review and triage SAST findings

**Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**:
- Perform DAST testing in staging environments
- Include authenticated and unauthenticated DAST scans
- Automate DAST testing where possible

**Penetration Testing**:
- Conduct regular penetration tests
- Use both automated and manual testing approaches
- Test from insider and outsider perspectives
- Validate security controls through penetration testing

**Security Unit Testing**:
- Write tests specifically for security controls
- Test for both positive and negative cases
- Include security regression tests
