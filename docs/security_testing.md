# Security Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the security testing strategy for the GoBackend Secure API. It defines the approach, methodology, and schedule for conducting comprehensive security assessments to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.

## Security Testing Types

### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

**Purpose**: Analyze source code to identify security vulnerabilities without executing the application.

**Tools**:
- GoSec for Go code analysis
- SonarQube for code quality and security scanning
- Semgrep for custom rule-based scanning

**Frequency**:
- Automated scanning in CI/CD pipeline for every pull request
- Weekly comprehensive scans of the entire codebase

**Responsible Team**: Security Engineering

### 2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

**Purpose**: Test the running application to identify vulnerabilities in its runtime behavior.

**Tools**:
- OWASP ZAP for automated scanning
- Burp Suite Professional for manual testing

**Frequency**:
- Automated scans weekly in the staging environment
- Full scan before each major release

**Responsible Team**: Security Operations

### 3. Dependency Scanning

**Purpose**: Identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies and libraries.

**Tools**:
- Snyk for dependency scanning
- OWASP Dependency-Check
- Go Dependency Scanner

**Frequency**:
- Daily automated scans
- Pre-merge checks for dependency updates

**Responsible Team**: Development Team with Security Engineering oversight

### 4. Infrastructure Security Testing

**Purpose**: Assess the security of infrastructure components supporting the application.

**Tools**:
- Terraform scanning tools (tfsec, terraform-compliance)
- Docker image scanning (Trivy, Clair)
- Kubernetes security scanning (Kubesec, Kube-bench)

**Frequency**:
- Weekly infrastructure scans
- Post-deployment verification

**Responsible Team**: DevOps and Security Operations

### 5. Manual Penetration Testing

**Purpose**: Conduct in-depth, human-led testing to identify complex vulnerabilities and attack chains.

**Scope**:
- Authentication and Authorization
- Data Access Controls
- API Security
- Tenant Isolation
- Encryption Implementation
- Session Management
- Business Logic Flaws

**Frequency**:
- Quarterly internal penetration tests
- Semi-annual external penetration tests by third-party security firm

**Responsible Team**: Internal Security Testing Team and External Security Consultants

## Penetration Testing Methodology

### Pre-Testing Phase

1. **Scope Definition**:
   - Define test boundaries (in-scope and out-of-scope systems)
   - Document sensitive areas requiring special handling
   - Establish emergency contacts

2. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Identify high-risk components
   - Determine potential impact of testing activities
   - Define rollback procedures

3. **Testing Authorization**:
   - Obtain formal approval from system owners
   - Schedule testing windows
   - Notify relevant stakeholders

### Testing Phase

1. **Reconnaissance**:
   - Information gathering
   - API endpoint discovery and mapping
   - Technology stack identification

2. **Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Automated vulnerability scanning
   - Configuration analysis
   - Security header verification

3. **Authentication Testing**:
   - Authentication bypass attempts
   - Credential brute forcing (with rate limiting consideration)
   - Multi-factor authentication tests
   - Password policy enforcement

4. **Authorization Testing**:
   - Role-based access control verification
   - Privilege escalation attempts
   - Cross-tenant access attempts
   - API permission testing

5. **Injection Testing**:
   - SQL injection
   - Command injection
   - NoSQL injection
   - Template injection

6. **Data Validation Testing**:
   - Input validation bypass
   - Output encoding issues
   - File upload vulnerabilities
   - XSS vulnerabilities

7. **Encryption Testing**:
   - Encryption implementation review
   - Key management verification
   - Transport security testing

8. **Business Logic Testing**:
   - Workflow bypass attempts
   - Race conditions
   - Logic flaw exploitation

9. **Multi-Tenancy Testing**:
   - Tenant isolation verification
   - Shared resource access control
   - Data leakage testing

### Post-Testing Phase

1. **Vulnerability Analysis**:
   - Identify and validate vulnerabilities
   - Assess severity and prioritize issues
   - Document exploitation paths

2. **Reporting**:
   - Detailed technical reports
   - Executive summary
   - Remediation recommendations

3. **Remediation Planning**:
   - Develop fix strategies
   - Assign ownership
   - Establish timelines

4. **Verification Testing**:
   - Validate fixes
   - Regression testing
   - Rescan for residual issues
