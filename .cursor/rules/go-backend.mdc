Always create higly secure code following the best coding practices like OWASP 10 coding principles. And it should be following Soc2 type 2 and other top compliances while creating the code.
This will be an enterprise application so it should be highly secure and fast while reading and writing records. GDPR, ISO 27001 and Soc 2 type 2 are the compliances which you should follow while giving code.
Don't give build and compilation errors.
